# plugins

## Overview

From the [official plugin documentation](https://go-vela.github.io/docs/plugins/overview/):

> A plugin is a Docker container that is designed to perform a set of pre-defined actions.
>
> These actions can be for any number of general tasks, including:
>
> * deploying code
> * publishing artifacts
> * sending notifications
> * much, much moreâ€¦

```yaml
version: "1"

steps:
  - name: plugin
    image: target/vela-docker:v0.1.0
    pull: true
    parameters:
      registry: index.docker.io
      repo: index.docker.io/octocat/hello-world
```

**NOTE: We recommend you review [Docker's best practices](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/) before attempting to create your own plugin.**

**NOTE: We recommend that all plugins be placed inside a [scratch image](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch).**

## Configuration

Typically, plugins are configured as a step in a pipeline and should accept their configuration via environment variables.

**NOTE: This has the added benefit of allowing plugins to be written in any language!**

We pass these variables in Vela using the `parameters` field. Any variable passed to this field, will be injected into the step as `PARAMETER_<thing>`:

```diff
version: "1"

steps:
  - name: plugin
    image: target/vela-docker:v0.1.0
    pull: true
+   parameters:
+     registry: index.docker.io
+     repo: index.docker.io/octocat/hello-world
```

From the above example, the following environment variables would be added:

* `PARAMETER_REGISTRY=index.docker.io`
* `PARAMETER_REPO=index.docker.io/octocat/hello-world`

## Build a Plugin

We have plugin guides for several different languages:

* [Bash](https://go-vela.github.io/docs/plugins/tutorials/bash/)
* [Go](https://go-vela.github.io/docs/plugins/tutorials/go/)
* [Node.js](https://go-vela.github.io/docs/plugins/tutorials/node/)
* [Python](https://go-vela.github.io/docs/plugins/tutorials/python/)
* [Ruby](https://go-vela.github.io/docs/plugins/tutorials/ruby/)

**NOTE: An example of these tutorials also exist in this repository.**
